# Milestone M2: String Table + Editor + Validation

## Goal

Implement the main workspace string table, the double-click editing dialog,
protected-token validation, the persisted status model, and search/filter/sort.

## Scope

- **String Table Grid:** A high-density, virtualized grid showing key, source string, target string, and a per-row validation/status indicator (full-row status tint).
- **Filter Toolbar:** Instant search (by key/original/target text) and a filter by status (per [SPEC.md §9](../../SPEC.md): `untranslated`, `translated`, `outdated`, `review-needed`, or all).
- **String Editor Dialog:** A modal triggered by double-clicking a row. Shows original text, editable target field, live token validation, status badge, clickable token chips, and **glossary hints** (official game terms found in the source, click to insert the translation — SPEC §7.5).
- **Protected-Token Validation:** `token-missing` and `token-added` are errors; `newline-mismatch` remains a warning because `\n` is layout, not syntax. `empty-target` and `json-invalid` retain their existing behavior, while `identical-to-source` and `escape-suspicious` are high-signal warnings. A **"token" is any Stardew/SMAPI protected token**, not just `{{...}}`: Content Patcher `{{...}}` (nested-aware), gender switch `${male^female}$`, mail commands `[#]` / `%item … %%`, dialogue break `#$b#`, bracket tokens `[…]`, **positional placeholders `{0}`**, dialogue commands `$b`/`$s`/`$e`, structural `#`, balanced single-quote delimiters such as `'test'`, and single-char `@`/`^`. Apostrophes inside words such as `don't` are ordinary prose. Tokens are compared as **multisets** (counts matter). See `src/strings/protectedTokens.ts` and `src-tauri/src/tokens.rs`.
- **Status Model:** Implement the four statuses from [SPEC.md §9](../../SPEC.md) — `untranslated`, `translated`, `outdated`, and the AI-workflow status `review-needed` — and their transitions during editing. (`outdated` is derived automatically, never set by hand. Strings intentionally kept in English use the **Keep original** action and remain covered by `outdated` detection.)
- **Outdated Logic:** Detect modified source strings via per-string `sourceHash` (SHA-256 of the English source at save time), compared on re-scan.

## Out of Scope

- Exporters, file saving, backups, or JSON generation (that is M3).
- External LLM batch translations (export/import — M4).
- API calls.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. String table handles high-density data (thousands of strings) without lag (row virtualization). ✅
2. Double-clicking a row opens a modal dialog that correctly updates the table on save. ✅
3. Token validation flags missing/added protected tokens (e.g. source has `{{PlayerName}}` or `$b`, target drops it → `token-missing` error). ✅
4. Editing a string updates its status per SPEC §9 (saving sets `translated`; F2 **Keep original** copies the source as an explicit translation; token errors surface as validation issues, **not** statuses). ✅
5. Multi-select via Ctrl+Click (toggle), Shift+Click (range), and `Ctrl+A` (select all visible). ✅
6. Right-click context menu with the v1 bulk actions (Edit, Copy original/translation, Mark translated, Keep original, Clear translation). ✅
7. Search bar filters results in real-time (across key/original/target). ✅
8. Status filter shows only strings of the selected status. ✅
9. Sorting by column (Key / Original / Translation / File; click to cycle asc → desc → off). ✅
10. Validation rules are covered by unit tests. ✅
11. Editor glossary hints: matched official terms shown, click inserts the translation (when a glossary is built). ✅

## Status (shipped vs. open) — 2026-06-09

**Shipped (PRs #7–#24):** virtualized string table with full-row status tint, double-click editor (live validation, token chips, status badge, keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+Enter/Esc/Alt+←→/F2/F3/F4), the full protected-token taxonomy compared as multisets, the 4-status model with persisted per-string state and surgical `outdated` detection, multi-select (Ctrl/Shift-click), and the right-click context menu with bulk actions.

**Also shipped (post-audit, 2026-06-09):** toolbar text **search** across key/original/target, **status filter** dropdown, **Ctrl+A** select-all-visible, **column sorting**, and **editor glossary hints** (matched official terms, click to insert). Filtering/sorting operate on a visible view while selection/editor navigation keep stable data indices.

**Also shipped (v1.1):** short, single-line translations can be edited directly
in the translation cell. Enter or focus loss saves through the existing
persistence path, Escape cancels, and live validation remains visible. Long or
multiline strings continue to use the full editor.

**Still open for v1:** none — M2 is functionally complete.

**Moved out of M2:** the **"Search Translation on Nexus"** action is deferred and
folded into the new [M5 — Nexus Translation Discovery & Download](m5-nexus-translation-download.md)
(the owner prefers the full SSE-AT-style assisted-download flow over a browser-search stopgap).

## Risks

- **Virtualization Requirements:** Large string counts can cause UI lag. (Mitigation: `@tanstack/react-virtual` row virtualization.)
- **Complex Token Syntax:** Real content mods (e.g. Ridgeside) lean heavily on dialogue/Content Patcher tokens, not just `{{...}}`. (Mitigation: the full taxonomy above is treated as protected and compared as multisets; no inner parsing of token contents.)

## Issue Breakdown (as shipped)

### Issue 7: String table ✅

Virtualized grid bound to scanner data, full-row status tint, selection.

### Issue 8: Double-click string editor dialog ✅

Editing overlay with original vs. translation, live validation, clickable token chips, status badge, keyboard shortcuts.

### Issue 9: Protected-token validation ✅

`extractProtectedTokens` reader for the full Stardew taxonomy; `token-missing`
and `token-added` are errors via **multiset** comparison; plus
`newline-mismatch`, `empty-target`, `json-invalid`, `identical-to-source`, and
`escape-suspicious`. The two quality rules warn but do not block.

### Issue 10: Status model and persistence ✅

The 4 v1 statuses and their transitions, with `sourceHash` tracking for
`outdated` detection. Translation state is persisted per target language and
mod (keyed by language code + UniqueID) separately from the mod's files.

### Issue 10b: Search / filter / sort ✅

Text search (key/original/target), status filter, and column sorting (asc → desc → off) for the string table — shipped post-audit; filtering/sorting operate on a visible view while selection/editor navigation keep stable data indices.

### V1.1 follow-up: Inline table editing ✅

Short, single-line targets use a compact one-at-a-time inline input. It reuses
the same save command and status transitions as the full editor, preserves
virtualized row identity, and falls back to the dialog for long or multiline
content.

## Agent Handoff Notes

_Keep the status set at exactly 4 (SPEC §19 #2). `review-needed` is one of
those four and only the AI workflows set it. Keep all table work inside the
existing two-panel layout — no extra panels (SPEC §19 #5)._
